# About
I’m a computer vision PhD student at [Queensland University of Technology](https://www.qut.edu.au/) in Australia. I’m currently working on representation and reconstruction of 3D objects from images. I spent an internship semester in 2017 in the [CI2CV lab](http://ci2cv.net/) in the [Robotics Institute](http://ri.cmu.edu/) ([CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/)) working on 3D reconstruction from a single image.
